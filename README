Event Machine WebSocket Server implementation
---------------------------------------------

1. Before launching the server. Make sure you create and edit
settings.yaml. For security reasons you should never add 
settings.yaml to a public repository.
	
	mv data/settings.yaml.example data/settings.yaml

2. Run a mongodb daemon on localhost:27017

3. Run server by executing em/daemon.rb

	Optional arguments:
	--dev	Launch server and accept connections from any origin.
	--verbose	Set EventMachine WebSockets to debug mode.
	
	
Libraries used:

EventMachine	http://rubyeventmachine.com/	
em-websockets	http://github.com/igrigorik/em-websocket
oauth-ruby	http://oauth.rubyforge.org/, http://github.com/oauth/oauth-ruby
MongoDB		http://mongodb.org, http://github.com/mongodb/mongo-ruby-driver
em-mongo	http://github.com/bcg/em-mongo
oauth-ruby	http://oauth.rubyforge.org/, http://github.com/oauth/oauth-ruby

Main action starts in main.js - instantiates App and binds eventlisteners to methods of App, disable default select on body

   var settings = new Settings();

	app = new App(settings, document.getElementById('canvas'));

  it also creates a setInterval "loop" running every 30 ms to update the view.
	setInterval(runLoop,30);
  var runLoop = function() {
  	app.update();
	app.draw();
  }


app.js in constructor:
    instanteates model, canvas, context, websocket, mouse, keyNav, etc.
  	webSocket 				= new WebSocket( model.settings.socketServer );
	
		model = new Model();
		model.settings = aSettings;

    var App = function(aSettings, aCanvas) { 

      ... so what were the settings passed in?

Settings.js
var Settings = function() {
  this.socketServer = 'ws://rumpetroll.motherfrog.com:8180';
}

so to run this locally... change this to local host where em is running?

Yes.

So now... when I move.. (keypress or mouse click), what message do I send to the server?

#in main.js
  
  	document.addEventListener('mousemove', 		app.mousemove, false);
	document.addEventListener('mousedown', 		app.mousedown, false);
	document.addEventListener('mouseup',			app.mouseup, false);

app.keydown sets model's momentum to maximum momentum, and key up sets it to zero.

what happens when you make a change to the model?

#well there is the ability to send messages here:
	app.sendMessage = function(msg) {
	  
	  if (messageQuota>0) {
	    messageQuota--;
	    webSocketService.sendMessage(msg);
	  }
	  
	}

#around line 104 so look for sendMessage to see if we are sending messages when we move

#around line 30, within update interval we have this:

		if(model.userTadpole.age % 6 == 0 && model.userTadpole.changed > 1 && webSocketService.hasConnection) {
			model.userTadpole.changed = 0;
     		webSocketService.sendUpdate(model.userTadpole);
		}

#looks like we update the server our local traveled coordinates if it was a significant distance
            
every time we move we broadcast our moment to everyone
we start moving with some momentum and giggling as soon as we arrive
if i arrive AFTER some existing peeps, i don't see them if they haven't moved in a while because they are not broadcasting
    messages are broadcast as type "message"
    "update" message update x,y coordiante as well as some vector
    receiving:{"type":"update","id":12,"angle":2.459,"momentum":0.038,"x":-10.3,"y":-39.4,"life":1,"name":"Guest 12","authorized":false} 
    receiving:{"type":"message","id":12,"message":"what is up"}
